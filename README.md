# analyzer

Python project for real-time financial analyzing and backtesting trading strategies

important: this project is a fork of the original https://github.com/panpanpandas/ultrafinance

Note: this project is still non working since I deleted DAM and model! there is a lot of work pending

Originally DAM and model was in the ultrafinance, but I want to have DAM more as plugins.
Also since I already have a relation model for stock market I wanted to adapt it to this project.
Moving this two as new project will maintain analyzer code small and it will be only used for real time analize.

So Please also check this projects:

 * Data Access https://github.com/llazzaro/analyzerdam 
 * Model https://github.com/llazzaro/pystock
 * Strategies https://github.com/llazzaro/analyzerstrategies
